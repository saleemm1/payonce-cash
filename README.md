## 🛑 The Problem: The "Middleman Tax"
The current digital economy is broken for creators. Legacy platforms (Stripe, Gumroad, PayPal) operate like feudal lords, not service providers.

* **The Fee Trap:** You lose **5% to 15%** of your hard-earned revenue to platform fees.
* **The Time Theft:** Why wait **7 to 14 days** for a payout? It's your money.
* **The Censorship:** One algorithm change or "policy update" can freeze your account forever.
* **The Barrier:** Millions of talented creators in unbanked regions are excluded entirely.

## 🟢 The Solution: PayOnce.cash
PayOnce is a **Financial Liberation Tool**. It is a decentralized, non-custodial Point-of-Sale (POS) and Digital Marketplace that uses **Bitcoin Cash (BCH)** to settle transactions in **seconds**, not days.

### ✨ Why We Win (Core Features)

| Feature | Legacy Systems (Web2) | PayOnce (Web3) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fees** | 3% - 15% + Fixed Fees | **0% Platform Fees** (You keep 100%) |
| **Settlement** | Weekly / Monthly | **Instant (0-Conf Speed)** |
| **Access** | KYC & Bank Required | **Permissionless (No ID)** |

## 🧬 Viral Mode: The Growth Engine
**"Turn every customer into a salesperson."**

Most decentralized apps fail because they lack marketing tools. PayOnce solves this with **Viral Mode**.

* **How it works:** A seller enables "Viral Mode" on their product.
* **The Incentive:** Anyone can share the product link. If a sale comes from their link, the smart contract **instantly splits** the payment.
* **The Magic:** 90% goes to the Seller, 10% goes to the Promoter.
* **Why it matters:** Unlike traditional affiliate programs that require dashboards and monthly payouts, PayOnce splits the money **atomically on-chain**. The promoter gets paid the *millisecond* the sale happens.

## 🧾 Merchant Terminal & Invoice System
We are not just for files; we are for **Real-World Business**.

* **The PayOnce Fix:** A cashier opens the "Retail Mode" on any phone/tablet. The customer scans a QR code. The system detects the payment in <2 seconds (0-Conf) and flashes "PAID". **Zero hardware cost.**

### 2. Freelance Invoicing 👤
* **Who is it for?** Designers, Developers, Writers, Consultants.
* **The Pain:** Chasing clients for wire transfers, losing money to exchange rates, waiting for Net-30 payment terms.

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

PayOnce achieves a "Stripe-like" UX by utilizing BCH-specific primitives:

1.  **0-Conf Fulfillment:** We bypass block confirmations (10min+) by monitoring the mempool for broadcasted hashes. This allows Instant Content Unlocking (<2s) while ensuring transaction validity.
2.  **Real-Time Fiat Oracle:** To eliminate volatility risk, we fetch high-frequency price data (`CoinGecko API`) at the millisecond of invoice creation to lock the exact Satoshi value.
3.  **IPFS Encryption:** Files are uploaded to IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and encrypted. The decryption key is only revealed to the client after the blockchain confirms the payment.
