## 🧩 Problem
Digital commerce today is controlled by centralized payment platforms that extract value and impose friction.

- **High fees:** 5–15% lost to processors  
- **Slow settlement:** payouts delayed for days or weeks  
- **Custodial risk:** accounts and funds can be frozen  
- **Global exclusion:** creators in unbanked regions are locked out  

Bitcoin Cash was designed for peer-to-peer payments — yet most commerce tools still behave like Web2 gatekeepers.

---

## ✅ Solution
**PayOnce.cash** is a non-custodial commerce protocol built on **Bitcoin Cash**, designed for real-world usage.

It allows anyone to:
- Sell digital products or services
- Accept in-person BCH payments
- Receive funds instantly via 0-conf settlement
- Keep **100%** of their revenue

PayOnce is not a marketplace.  
It is a **payment primitive** creators and merchants own.

---

## 🛠️ Developers: The PayOnce SDK
> **New Feature:** We turned PayOnce into a protocol.

Developers can now embed non-custodial checkout buttons into **any app, game, or website** with a single line of code. No backend required.

**Stateless:** Logic is encoded in the URL.

**Tamper-Proof:** Includes HMAC-SHA256 signatures to prevent client-side price manipulation.

**Instant**: Zero setup time.
