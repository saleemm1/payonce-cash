## 🧩 Problem
Modern creators and small merchants are trapped inside centralized payment platforms.

- **High Fees:** 5–15% lost to processors and marketplaces  
- **Delayed Settlement:** payouts take days or weeks  
- **Custodial Risk:** platforms can freeze funds at any time  
- **Global Exclusion:** millions remain unbanked or restricted  

Bitcoin Cash was designed for peer-to-peer money — yet most commerce tools still behave like Web2 gatekeepers.

---

## ✅ Solution: PayOnce.cash
**PayOnce** is a non-custodial commerce layer on **Bitcoin Cash** that enables anyone to sell digital goods, services, or in-person products with:

- **0% platform fees**
- **Instant 0-conf settlement**
- **No KYC, no intermediaries**
- **Direct BCH payments, peer-to-peer**

PayOnce is not a marketplace.  
It is a **payment primitive** creators own.

## 🧬 Viral Mode (On-Chain Affiliate Logic)
PayOnce introduces a **native growth mechanic** for Bitcoin Cash commerce.

**How it works**
- Seller enables *Viral Mode*
- Anyone can share the product link
- Smart logic **splits the payment atomically** at purchase time

**Default split**
- 90% → Seller  
- 10% → Promoter  

No dashboards. No payout delays.  
Promoters are paid **the moment the transaction hits the mempool**.
